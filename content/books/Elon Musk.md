Summary: Book review - Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance

Very inspirational Elon Muskâ€™s biography, man who always go forward.

Two things impressed me:

1. His dedication to business details and his willingness to learn so he can make the right decisions.

2. That before he went into business with SpaceX and SolarCity, he had no idea about those industries, other than a childhood dream of traveling to Mars sometime.
