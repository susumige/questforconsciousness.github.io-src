Summary: Book review - Lust for life by Irving Stone

Biography of the famous Vincent Van Gogh.     

Vincent Van Gogh was actually a "bad" painter, he didn't sell any paintings for life. 
What made him famous happened afterwards. 
Over 600 letters that he exchanged with his brother were published as a book by his 
brother's wife, Johanna. 
The book is probably one of the first successful marketing campaigns and one of the first 
successful examples of storytelling. The connections between Vincent's tragic life 
described in the book and his paintings made him one of the greatest painters of all time.
