Summary: Book review - Bad blood by John Carreyrou

If you are ambitious and persuasive enough about yourself and then others because people tend to believe what they want to happen then you can make a $ 10 billion company out of ordinary lie.

By halfway through the book I was thinking of giving up reading and then suddenly the book became a well-directed thriller. Attacks, threats and blackmail to cover up the biggest fraud in the history of the startup world.
