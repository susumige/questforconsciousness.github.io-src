Summary: Book review - The Silicon Valley Challenge by Christoph Keese

A great story on how things work in Silicon Valley from different perspectives, and explanation why Europeans will never have a unicorn startup.

In this book, I learned for the first time what "disrupt" really means and why the ecosystem is the most important thing for a startup to succeed.
