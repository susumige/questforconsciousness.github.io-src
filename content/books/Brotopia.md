Summary: Book review - Brotopia by Emily Chang

The book begins with the topic of gender inequality in the IT industry and how it came about throughout history.

If, like me, you thought the startup movement was the most exalted thing the human race has produced, you were fooled. Sexual extortion and harassment, gender discrimination in a word "the modern wild west". Only mens and girls who accepted the rules of the game have access to the club.
