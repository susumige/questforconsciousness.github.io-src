Summary: Book review - Shoe Dog by Phil Knight

An excellent book on how much work and time it takes to make a successful business, and in the end, apart from these two things, you cannot succeed without much luck and aligning many other things that sometimes you may not have an impact on.

A recommendation for anyone planning to start or already own a business.
