Summary: Book review - Data smart by John W. Foreman

Data science book for "ordinary people". 

You do not need to complete an advanced data science course to use popular statistical methods and algorithms. It is enough that you are relatively comfortable working in Excel and have some common sense. Everything else needed is described in this book.
