Summary: Book review - Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark

Bill Gates classified this book in his “10 Favorite Books about Technology”. Elon Musk said that it was the book that made the biggest impression on him.

I especially liked the first chapter describing the scenario so that AI could conquer humanity, as in a good SciFi story.
