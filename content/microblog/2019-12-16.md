A few days ago I met my colleague from college after many years. After the initial exchange of info about family, work... he concluded that I am the only one who started its own business from a whole group of students who enrolled studies that year. In total it was more than 100 people.  

I was surprised by the fact, I never thought about it that way, is it possible that only 1% or less of graduate students start their own business...? 

I checked some statistics online and found this: "data shows that 4.7% of recent graduates are self-employed or freelance, with only 0.6% having started their own business. This compares with 8.7% of the general population who have started a business in the last three years."

What is a problem there: a lot of time and money invested in their education, and after all that working on a business idea may require long hours and initial low pay, fear of failing and what others will say, or something else...?
