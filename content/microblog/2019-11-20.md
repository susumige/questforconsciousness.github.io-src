Let me explain a teaser "Create more time, not money..." at the top of this page with the following link: 

"_[Time Is the Ultimate Success, Not Money](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/305389)      
Don't use your time to make more money, use your money to make more time._" 

This perfectly fits with Singularity. One day some "artificial intelligence" will work for us and we will have all the time for ourselves.
