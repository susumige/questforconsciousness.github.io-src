A few observations from my startup adventure: 

* Before anything else make sure you have founders fit.
* Never compare KIDS and STARTUP FOUNDERS to each other.
* Ultimate goal of every company founder: Become a consultant in your own company.
* Whether a pessimist can become an entrepreneur, or in other words, are all entrepreneurs optimistic?
